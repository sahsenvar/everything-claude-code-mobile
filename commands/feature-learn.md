# Feature Learn Command

View patterns learned from feature builds. Displays instincts captured during Phase 7 (Learning), confidence scores, and feature completeness history over time.

## Usage

```bash
# Show all learned feature patterns
/feature-learn

# Show patterns for a specific feature
/feature-learn auth

# Export learned patterns for sharing across projects
/feature-learn --export
```

## Flags

| Flag | Values | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| *(none)* | | Show all learned patterns and completeness scores |
| `<name>` | Feature name | Show learning details for a specific feature |
| `--export` | | Export all learned patterns to `.omc/exports/feature-instincts.json` |

## Output

## Data Sources

- **Learning summaries:** `.omc/state/feature-{name}-learning.json`
- **Instincts database:** `~/.claude/instincts/mobile-instincts.json`
- **Feature plans:** `.omc/plans/feature-{name}.json`
- **Feature state:** `.omc/state/feature-{name}.json`

## How It Works

1. Reads all `feature-*-learning.json` files from `.omc/state/`
2. Loads the instincts database to show current confidence scores
3. Aggregates completeness scores across all features
4. For `--export`, calls `exportInstincts()` to produce a portable file

## No Agents Invoked

This command reads from local state and instinct files only. No agents are spawned.
