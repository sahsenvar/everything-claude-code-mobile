# Feature Verify Command

Phase 6 of the feature build pipeline. Final verification gate that confirms the feature is production-ready through repeated test runs and coverage analysis.

## Usage

```bash
/feature-verify auth
/feature-verify offline-cache
/feature-verify push-notifications
```

## Verification Steps

1. **pass@k Testing** (k=3): `mobile-verifier` runs the full test suite 3 times to detect flakiness
2. **Coverage Report**: Generates coverage using platform tooling
   - Android: Kover (`./gradlew koverHtmlReport`)
   - iOS: xcov (`xcrun xccov`)
3. **Threshold Check**: Validates coverage meets the 80% minimum
4. **Sign-off Report**: Produces final summary with pass/fail determination

## Thresholds

| Metric | Threshold | Action if Below |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| pass@k | >= 0.9 (90%) | Flaky tests must be fixed or quarantined |
| Coverage | >= 80% | Missing tests must be added |
